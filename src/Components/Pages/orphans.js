          Without the sponsorship or help of a charitable organization, orphans
          would almost certainly have to work or beg. Orphans left alone are
          vulnerable to food shortages or disease. They are at high risk of
          being taken advantage of or abused. When you sponsor an orphan with
          our Charity Organization, you give him/her the opportunity to have a
          childhood, an education and a roof to sleep at night.

          have a family. Your sponsorship is the only way to change the path of
          an orphan's life that didn't start well.

          only focus on what he can learn in school. The knowledge he acquires
          through education is the basic foundation of his future.
